## :question: About the Project ##

I've always pursued varied and lofty learning goals, but ~~sometimes~~ often life happens and it can throw me off the path. A little bit of a nudge or encouragement back to the habits and practices that will take me to my goal is often needed, and sometimes that nudge needs to be more like a poke in the side - enter **Learn or Pay**.

The premise is simple - either you spend time learning or you pay for it. The app will alert users when it is time to study their materials (at intervals and times pre-determined by the users), and if they can't or won't study at those times then a payment will automatically be sent to a person or account of their choice.

## :pencil: How it will be Made ##

Tech Used: React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

**Learn or Pay** is still in its infant stage, but I intend to create and release it in stages, adding additional functionality and features as a I go.

Stage 1: Launch landing page with interest list sign-up (in progress, eta 3/25)

Future stages will allow users to add study materials to their portal, select study reminder times and frequencies, payment amounts and target accounts, notification options, import study materials from other sources, and other future features.

## :calendar: Check back soon! ##

This project will be my focus for the coming weeks, so please check back here, shoot me a message through the [live site](https://learnorpay.carrd.co/), or on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/blawblawLaw). :blush:
